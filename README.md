Madis Tepp Portfolio 



This is my portfolio page created for Milestone 1 project in Code Institute. Purpose of the page is to be able to sell my services, show of my works, skills and history
so that it would lead to potential co-operation people looking for web development, need a site to be created or job offers from companies.




UX:

When designing this page it was important for me to keep it easy to use and use a black-grey-white color scheme through out the project for modern look.
I aimed provide as much relevant information as possible about myself, like links to my social pages, as well as form to contact me, download resume possibility and contact details in order for people to get a full overview of me.

Some user stories that i was aiming to solve were: 

1. As a owner of the site i want to be be able to show off my works, provide people with my contacts and history about me.
   So that i can sell my services and advance in my professional life and career. 
2. As an HR employee visiting this site i want to get a better understanding of the capabilities, competencies and background of this sites owner, i also want to be able to download a CV.
   So that i can understand if this person fits to the role i am looking for, and that i could provide info about this person onwards to my team for a potential job offer.
3. As a user of this site i want to be able to see previous projects and be able to take contact with the site owner.
   So that i can get in contact with this person for co-operation.

Initial wireframes can be found here:

The design changed somewhat as i progressed and understood what works well and what does not. 




Existing features:

Iframe on home page: 
Idea was to add a video to show off the design thinking that is used when working on projects. 

Form on contact page: 
Allows user to be able to contact me for potential project co-operation. This was created by using Bootstrap and then modified to match the style of other pages.

Navbar: 

Used bootstrap to create a responsive navbar. 


Features left to be implemented: 

Iframe video to be changed to a self created video to show of more about myself and way of working.
Works done section will be updated to contain own works once more jobs will be done. 
Price quote possibility to be added in the future.






Technologies Used:

Testing: 


Deployed site was tested by using using the page on Firefox, Google Chrome, Explored and Microsoft Edge.
In addition to that page was tested by using it on different devices such as Samsung Galaxy S10, Iphone XR , Samsung Galaxy A5.

Code has been check on https://validator.w3.org/ and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ to make sure no errors in the code that would prevent functions.

User testing performed by having 4 people with to use the page on browser and device of choice. Users asked to give feedback and some change implemented based on feedback.

Form functions have been verified i.e not possible to submit without filling in all required info, e-mail needs to be a valid email format. 

Links to social sites, link to download CV adn works done functioning as designed with target="_blank" so they open in a new window.
