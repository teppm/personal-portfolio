Madis Tepp Portfolio 

This is my portfolio page created for Milestone 1 project in Code Institute. Purpose of the page is to be able to sell my services, show of my works, skills and history
so that it would lead to potential co-operation people looking for web development, need a site to be created or job offers from companies.


UX:

When designing this page it was important for me to keep it easy to use and use a black-grey-white color scheme through out the project for modern look.
I aimed provide as much relevant information as possible about myself, like links to my social pages, as well as form to contact me, download resume possibility and contact details in order for people to get a full overview of me.

Some user stories that i was aiming to solve were: 

1. As a owner of the site i want to be be able to show off my works, provide people with my contacts and history about me.
   So that i can sell my services and advance in my professional life and career. 
2. As an HR employee visiting this site i want to get a better understanding of the capabilities, competencies and background of this sites owner, i also want to be able to download a CV.
   So that i can understand if this person fits to the role i am looking for, and that i could provide info about this person onwards to my team for a potential job offer.
3. As a user of this site i want to be able to see previous projects and be able to take contact with the site owner.
   So that i can get in contact with this person for co-operation.

Initial wireframes can be found here: 
https://github.com/teppm/personal-portfolio/tree/master/wireframes

The design changed somewhat as i progressed and understood what works well and what does not. 

Existing features:

Iframe on home page: 
Idea was to add a video to show off the design thinking that is used when working on projects. 

Form on contact page: 
Allows user to be able to contact me for potential project co-operation. This was created by using Bootstrap and then modified to match the style of other pages.

Navbar: 

Used bootstrap to create a responsive navbar. 


Features left to be implemented: 

Iframe video to be changed to a self created video to show of more about myself and way of working.
Works done section will be updated to contain own works once more jobs will be done. 
Price quote possibility to be added in the future.


Technologies Used:

1.CSS - Used to style HTML elements, to make the page visually appealing and stand out.
2.HTML - HTML used to create paget structure and content.
3.Bootstrap - used to simplify work and to be able to work smarter and save time by using pre created bootstrap solutions. 



Testing: 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
